# gba-card-matching-game
A Pokemon-themed card matching game written for the Game Boy Advance.

The objective of the game, as the name suggests, is to match cards together until there are no unmatched cards left.
You do this by flipping two cards at a time. If they match, they will stay flipped. Otherwise, they will flip face down again.
You will have to remember which cards you have flipped before and what card they were to get more matches!
